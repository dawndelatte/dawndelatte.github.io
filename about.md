<h1>Hi, I'm Dawn.</h1>

<p>I am currently a student at <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/austin/">The Iron Yard Academy</a> for Web Design. I grew up in New Orleans, La and moved to Austin 4 years ago. I love my heritage and try to cook and bake as much from my Maw Maw's cookbooks as possible. In college I studied visual art, and have a deep love of the creative process. For this reason, I knew I needed to find a path that allowed me to live the way I want to with my friends and family, while staying engaged in that process. Cheers to learning and Web Design!</p>
