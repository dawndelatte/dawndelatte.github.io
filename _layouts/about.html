    <h1>Hi there, I'm Dawn.</h1>
      <p>I'm currently studying User Interface Design at The Iron Yard here in Austin, Texas. I love diving deep into the creative process and finding new ways to solve problems—whether it's web design , cooking , or making puns out of pop songs and coding syntax.</p>

		<h2>Well, how did I get here?</h2>
		<div class="nola_atx"></div>
		<p>I grew up in New Orleans and left home at 18 to move all around the south, perusing a degree in Fine Arts. In 2010 my Husband and I, along with our dog and cat, packed up our things and moved to the “big city”. I fell in love with Austin, and web design, and haven't looked back since.</p>
