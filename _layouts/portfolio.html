		<h2>Hi there, I'm Dawn.</h2>
		<p> I’m a design leader, mentor, and strategist. I’ve spent the last 9 years consulting at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a> in various capacities. My best experiences have been meeting new clients, internalizing their problems, and using critical thinking, customer discovery, and product validation practices to hone in on a new, in some cases innovative, product solution for businesses. I’ve had the honor of managing and learning from other consultants, and collaborating with incredibly talented product designers, managers, and engineers.
