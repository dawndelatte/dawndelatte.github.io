				<h2>Hi there, I'm Dawn.</h2>
				<p> I’m a design leader, mentor, and strategist. I’ve spent the last 9 years consulting at <a
						href="https://thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a>, working with startups and enterprises in various
					industries. My best experiences have
					been meeting new clients, deeply understanding their problems, and using critical thinking, customer
					discovery, and product validation practices to hone in on a new product solution for their
					businesses. My design roots began in art college then led me
					to a code bootcamp, which landed me in roles in visual design, UI/UX, and front-end development.
					I’ve had the honor of managing, learning from, and collaborating
					with incredibly talented product designers and engineers over the years.
