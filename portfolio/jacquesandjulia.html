		<h2>About this project</h2>
		 
		<p>This was the first website I ever completed at the Iron Yard and on my own! Originally this was based on a template used for students learning about HTML, CSS, and Responsive Web Design, which I later converted to Sass and replaced the content with my own. </p>
