		<h2>About this project</h2>		 
		<p>This was the first website I ever completed at the Iron Yard and on my own! Originally this was based on a template used for students learning about HTML, CSS, and Responsive Web Design, which I later converted to Sass and replaced the content with my own. </p>

		<div class="project_bubble_right">
		<p>Here I used multiple backgrounds to create an overlay on the photos in there regular state and be full color on their hover state. This is also an example of how I made the content flow in different media queries.</p>
