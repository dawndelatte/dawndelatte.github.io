		<p>This was the first website I ever completed at the Iron Yard and on my own! Originally this was based on a template used for students learning about HTML, CSS, and Responsive Web Design, which I later converted to Sass and replaced the content with my own. </p>

	<div class="project_statement"><p>Originally, this was a project we did with the Perfect Pixel chrome plugin, to learn different ways to use HTML and CSS to position content on a web page. We were asigned to match it perfectly with the template our teacher provided. Later, after learning more about Responsive Web Design and Sass, I converted all of the CSS to Sass, created a better file structure, and made the site responsive, with three media queries.</p></div>
