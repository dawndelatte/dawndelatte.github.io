		<h2>About this project</h2>		 
		<p>This was the first website I ever completed at the Iron Yard and on my own! Originally this was based on a template used for students learning about HTML, CSS, and Responsive Web Design, which I later converted to Sass and replaced the content with my own. In week two of class, I used photos and content assigned to us by our teacher, and used a Chrome pixel perfect plugin to position the content. Later on, when we learned about Responsive Web Design and Sass, I converted all of my CSS to Sass, and made the layout fluid and then added 3 media queries to make it responsive.</p>

		<p>Here I used multiple backgrounds to create an overlay on the photos in there regular state and be full color on their hover state. This is also an example of how I made the content flow in different media queries.</p>
