		<h2>About this project</h2>
	<p> <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> is a site that has been around for over a decade, which web designers and developers use to “show the power of CSS”. For this project, we were not allowed to touch the HTML. Instead, I used psuedo classes to create extra divs and multiple background images to layer and create more depth. This was my first project using Bourbon, CSS animation, and SVGs. I found Bourbon to be very helpful with efficiency when using animations and linear gradients. From sketching, to wireframes, to codepens, this process showed me that there are many, many ways to use CSS to create beautiful websites.
