	<h2>About this project</h2>
	<p> This project was a redesign for the GoodReads web app. I designed three pages for this app with <a href="http://ustwo.com/ppp/">pixel perfect precision</a> in Photoshop, and used Illustrator for the logo design. I began this project with a lot of research, interviewing different users and doing competitor and S.W.O.T analysisâ€™ to decide what content was being used the most and how to focus my design.</p>

	I got a lot of feedback on how crowded the app feels, and how unessecessary some of the features and content were for most users. So my inspiration for the layout was a card catalog system, that created a really organized and clean experience.</p>

	<p>I used drop down menus to consolidate some of the features and to really focus on conent users find most useful, like Author updates and Book recommendations.</p>

	<p>This is an example of one of the style tile/element collages I used when exploring typography, color, and inspirations for this projects theme and layout. I used word lists and images I was inspired by to draw colors from. Some of these things were adjusted when putting the different elements together in the design comp. </p>
