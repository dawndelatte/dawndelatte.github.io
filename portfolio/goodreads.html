		<h2>About this project</h2>
	<p> This project was a redesign for the GoodReads web app. I designed three pages for this app with pixel perfect precision in Photoshop, and used Illustrator for the logo design. I began this project with a log of research. I interviewed other users and did competitor and S.W.O.T analysis' to decide what content was being used the most and how to focus my design.</p>

		<p>One of my goals for this app was to make it much more clean by reorganizing content so that it wasn't crowding unnecessary parts of the app. My inspiration for the layout was a card catalog system.</p>

		<p>I received a lot of feedback from other users about wanting to see more from Authors. So I gave some hierarchy to Author related content, and put more Author updates in the community feeds.</p>
