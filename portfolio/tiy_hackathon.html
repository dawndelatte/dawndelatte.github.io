		<h2>About this project</h2>
		 
		<p>This was a group project between myself, a Front End/Javacript student, and a Ruby on Rails student. I was the lead desginer on this team and contributed the Style Tiles, Wireframes, HTML, and Sass. We have 3 days to build a fully functional app and present it to the teachers and other students.</p>
