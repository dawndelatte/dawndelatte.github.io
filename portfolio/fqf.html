		<h2>About this project</h2>
		 
		<p>This project was a resign of The French Quarter Festival held in New Orleans, La. It has become Louisiana's second largest festival and represents the best of local culture, food, music, film, and visual art. The festival truly embodies the unique and diverse culture of the French Quarter, and currently their website does not reflect that. My goals for this project were to give it a unique and contemporary design, that stands out from the other festivals in the "umbrella site" it is currently a part of. I also wanted to give it a really organized navigation system that focuses on scheduled events and locations for festival attendees. </p><p>We were given two weeks to complete this project. I started with research and competitor analysis, went into Photoshop for my style tiles, wireframes, and comps, and used Illustrator to create all of the logos and icons for this site, before diving into production.</p>

		<div class="project_bubble_right">
			<p>Here I used lighten and darken properties in Sass to create type hierarchy between the vendors, as well as for event times and information on other pages. I also created a set of icons that indicate which vendor has gluten free and/or vegetarian options.</p>

		<div class="project_bubble_left">
			<p>I created these icons in Illustrator and used them as svg images on the homepage and as backgrounds throughout the site as well. They are intended to be more playful and iconic of New Orleans, so I also applied a subtle animation to each one on its hover state.</p>
