### Floating _(Left)_ in a Sea of Unfamiliarity

The day is finally here! I have started my journey at The Iron Yard. After months of wavering between feelings of excitment and slight terror, I jumped in ... sort of blindly. I had already attended a week of the Front End Engineering class, so I felt like I had a good "practice round" in. But nothing really prepared me for the sheer amount of information and exercise my brain was getting. 

Many of my classmates and fellow iron yarders were so willing to share their experiences and insights. I found myself learning a lot more than **HTML** and **CSS**. I was (and still am) trying to learn about myself and how I work and what kind of attitudes hold me back or help me to move forward.  I am learning to trust. To trust my instructors, my peers, and myself. 

The first week was overwhelming, but not in the way that I expected. I was overwhelmed with feelings of self-doubt and anxiety, and that was matched by encouragment from Sam and the other Iron Yard team leaders. This is a community of people who were in the same _sea_, on their own boats. 

I never considered myself a great student in college. So I felt like this was my second chance. This was a challenge though when I began to feel inadequite because the ever illusive "click" was not happening. I know, I know, nothing's going to click in the first week, but quieting those thoughts are a lot harder for me. The more I worked, and the further we got in class, the more I realized that the clicking was there, but it came in what I like to call a "gentle whisper".

Week One left me <strike>feeling</strike> knowing that I was, in fact, in the right place and had made the right decision to leave it all behind, and join The Iron Yard in song and pun into a _whole new world_.
