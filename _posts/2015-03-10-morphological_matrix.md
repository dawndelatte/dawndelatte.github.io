Wowza! It's been 3.5 weeks since I've written a blog post. In Iron Yard time that likes 2 light years? All the things have happened/been learned. Let me list a few before jumping into what I like to call the morphological mind maze of logo design.

We did a weekend hackathon where one designer teamed up with a front end student and a back end student. That was an huge rush of emotions and energy and I made it out alive with an amazing project, new friends and role models, and a big ole medal for "best overall app" in all the land AKA TIY. You can check out my teams app [here](https://women-power.herokuapp.com/#/dashboard).

We then dove right into coding our restaurant redesign projects that we have been reseraching and prototyping for the past few weeks. It was a challenge to get back into coding after spending time focusing on design theory, but it was good to jump right back it. Practice makes perfect! You can check out the progress of that project [here](http://dawndelatte.github.io/tiy_assignments/day_30/).

Now â€“ Would you like to take the red pill or the blue pill? 
Just kidding, you don't have a choice. Welcome to the morphological matrix....

I expanded on the word list I created a few weeks ago when creating style tiles and researching the theme of the website. From there, I used a "morphological matrix" to connect those words and phrases to icons or images that were associated. This was the basis for the 50 sketches that followed. I took two ideas/images and meshed them together by either random selection or to carry out an idea or theme I wanted to iterate a little further.

The first round was awesome. And also hilarious. How does one draw a beer barrel and pizza together to form a simple logo? Or a picnic blanket and keg? I tried.

So we critiqued and narrowed it down to a few logos to explore even further. Now we're starting to get somewhere!

I'm so excited to start using Illustrator and see what these sketches can really do.
