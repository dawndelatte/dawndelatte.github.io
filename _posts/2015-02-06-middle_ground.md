### On _Middle_ Ground 

I'm starting to feel like I get it.. sort of.. I think. There are no big lows, thank goodness, and no big highs, besides still being here. 

We were assigned a video to watch in our weekend homework that really put some things into perspective. [It's Dangerous to go Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY) talks about _Imposter Syndrome_ and ways to help yourself or your coworkers overcome some of the hurdles people with insecurities about their skills face (eg. _me_).

My mind is in a continual state of **blown**. I'm starting to feel like myself, except that there's this weird state you get in when you code for too long without a break called HYSTERIA. That's where the singing happens, and puns happen (get it -- git it?), and it's also where your mind shuts down and everything you know to be true is not working.

That's when you need a break, sun shine and/or food. It's amazing the amount of time you can spend on one itty bitty problem only to take a quick shower and discover mid-rinse that you put the right information in THE WRONG PLACE!

Lesson learned, Week Two, lesson learned.
