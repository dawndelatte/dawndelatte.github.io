### Dawn : 1

### Grids : 0 

We are learning about grids y'all. It seems like an simple enough concept. Make a grid with columns and gutters, do a little math, and voil&agrave;! We had a great lecture, devised a genius formula, and I was feeling pretty good about it.

<div class="grid_embed"><p data-height="214" data-theme-id="12242" data-slug-hash="OPzWvL" data-default-tab="result" data-user="dawndelatte" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/dawndelatte/pen/OPzWvL/'>12 column grid with col-num formula</a> by Dawn Delatte (<a href='http://codepen.io/dawndelatte'>@dawndelatte</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></div>

But then we were given ten sites to look at, decide their grid layouts, and draw them in our moleskines (thanks TIY!) I eased into the first few sites like [Nest](https://nest.com/) and [Mashable](http://mashable.com/) with fairly straight forward layouts, then Sam hit us with things like her [Roomba product page on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GK3IVW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) ... What is that?!

I started "coloring outside the lines" if you will. I wouldn't say I'm a perfectionist by any stretch of the imagination but this was **hard**. What should have taken about 2 hours, took me 6 and it was the first time I was rushing to "complete" an assignment minutes before class started. Commiting to _those_ lines with _that_ pen made html look like strawberry cupcakes. 

Mmmm cupcakes.
