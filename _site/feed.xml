        <title>Week Two</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-middle-ground&quot;&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Middle&lt;/em&gt; Ground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to feel like I get it.. sort of.. I think. There are no big lows, thank goodness, and no big highs, besides still being here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were assigned a video to watch in our weekend homework that really put some things into perspective. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY&quot;&gt;It’s Dangerous to go Alone&lt;/a&gt; talks about &lt;em&gt;Imposter Syndrome&lt;/em&gt; and ways to help yourself or your coworkers overcome some of the hurdles people with insecurities about their skills face (eg. &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind is in a continual state of &lt;strong&gt;blown&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m starting to feel like myself, except that there’s this weird state you get in when you code for too long without a break called HYSTERIA. That’s where the singing happens, and puns happen (get it – git it?), and it’s also where your mind shuts down and everything you know to be true is not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when you need a break, sun shine and/or food. It’s amazing the amount of time you can spend on one itty bitty problem only to take a quick shower and discover mid-rinse that you put the right information in THE WRONG PLACE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned, Week Two, lesson learned. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week One</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;floating-left-in-a-sea-of-unfamiliarity&quot;&gt;Floating &lt;em&gt;(Left)&lt;/em&gt; in a Sea of Unfamiliarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day is finally here! I have started my journey at The Iron Yard. After months of wavering between feelings of excitment and slight terror, I jumped in … sort of blindly. I had already attended a week of the Front End Engineering class, so I felt like I had a good “practice round” in. But nothing really prepared me for the sheer amount of information and exercise my brain was getting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my classmates and fellow iron yarders were so willing to share their experiences and insights. I found myself learning a lot more than &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt;. I was (and still am) trying to learn about myself and how I work and what kind of attitudes hold me back or help me to move forward.  I am learning to trust. To trust my instructors, my peers, and myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week was overwhelming, but not in the way that I expected. I was overwhelmed with feelings of self-doubt and anxiety, and that was matched by encouragment from Sam and the other Iron Yard team leaders. This is a community of people who were in the same &lt;em&gt;sea&lt;/em&gt;, on their own boats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never considered myself a great student in college. So I felt like this was my second chance. This was a challenge though when I began to feel inadequite because the ever illusive “click” was not happening. I know, I know, nothing’s going to click in the first week, but quieting those thoughts are a lot harder for me. The more I worked, and the further we got in class, the more I realized that the clicking was there, but it came in what I like to call a “gentle whisper”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week One left me &lt;strike&gt;feeling&lt;/strike&gt; knowing that I was, in fact, in the right place and had made the right decision to leave it all behind, and join The Iron Yard in song and pun into a &lt;em&gt;whole new world&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
